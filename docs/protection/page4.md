**Data security** means protecting your information from getting into the wrong hands. Make sure only the right people can access your system. This system is set up with the following: 

Two-factor-authentication (2FA) 

Role Based Access including data field level security 

SSL/TLS certificates 

Password rules 

**Additional recommendations:** 

- Do Not collect more data than is necessary for the purpose of the specific program.
- Do Not keep data for longer than necessary.
- Performing monthly/bi-monthly access review.

This is strongly advised to delete the files after doing the duplication check in way that cannot be easily recovered. The User may apply additional measures such as protecting the workbook with a password. In Microsoft Excel, this can be done following this steps:
