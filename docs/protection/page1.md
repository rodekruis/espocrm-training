Data Protection

How is the data protected? 

  510, digital and data unit, is part of the The Netherlands Red Cross (NLRC). The NLRC has a **Data Protection Policy** enforced since 2018. **Both the NLRC and EspoCRM adhere to the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**. In case NS maintains its own EspoCRM instance, it is a data processor. For more information about data processor: https://www.gdpreu.org/the-regulation/key-concepts/data-controllers-and-processors/ 

  The National Society is the data controller and is therefore responsible for any data entered into the platform. Your partners should therefore be informed and in compliance with their data protection legislation.

  NS must decide how long project data can be stored in the system and how it will be deleted or anonymized after the program is closed. 

**Data collected with third party tool** Third party handle the data storage. For instance, data collected with KOBO tool will be stored on KOBO servers and fall under their data protection policy. Kindly note this is separate from EspoCRM data process.
