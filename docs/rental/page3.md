# Matches

Under the matches tab, you get the overview of all the matches registered in the system. A match is the combination of an affected household and a rental accommodation or host family complying with matching criteria.  You can open existing matches and review the information by clicking on the match name (e.g. HH00033 – AC00018). Additionally, you can create a new match. 

## Main components of the form


**1. Create a new match**

-	Click on `Create match` at the top right of the page

-	Select the affected household
  
-	Select the accommodation
  
-	Fill in the required information
  
-	You can fill in banking details under the `financial information` tab. It is important to select who should receive the cash transfer (e.g. the landlord, host family or affected household)
  
-	You can upload supporting documents such as contracts under the `supporting documents` tab
  
-	The status of the match can be changed throughout the process (`new, pending, confirmed, completed`)
  
**2. Monitoring**

After the affected household moved into the accommodation, a red cross (case) worker can be assigned to the match. The case worker can keep track of the engagements with the affected household or property owner by logging the information under ‘monitoring’.
