# Matches

Under the matches tab, you get the overview of all the matches registered in the system. A match is the combination of an affected household and a rental accommodation or host family complying with matching criteria.  You can open existing matches and review the information by clicking on the match name (e.g. HH00033 – AC00018). Additionally, you can create a new match.
