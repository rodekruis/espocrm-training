# Cash distributions
Create a new cash distribution to define the financial details of a new cash transfer. 


## Main steps to take 


**1. Create a new Cash distribution**

By creating a new Cash distribution, you can specify the information for a new cash transfer. It is possible to create a ‘one off’ transfer or to schedule a daily, weekly, bi-weekly or monthly transfer. With the cash distribution you can create transfers for an individual or for a group. 

-	Click on `Create cash distribution` 
  
-	Fill in the required information
  
-	Set the transfer date: the date on which the transfer is due. In case you want to schedule multiple payments, the transfer date will be the start date
  
-	Define the frequency of the transfer: one off, daily, weekly, bi-weekly or monthly
  
-	Define the total number of transfers: for example, 6 monthly payments
