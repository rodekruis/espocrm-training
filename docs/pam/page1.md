# Backend Formulas and Logic

### 1. Name Field
- **Logic**: The `name` field is generated dynamically:
  - If `extraName` is provided: `name = firstName + " " + extraName + " " + lastName`.
  - If `extraName` is not provided: `name = firstName + " " + lastName`.

### 2. Age Calculation
- **Logic**: The `age` field is calculated as the difference (in years) between the current date and the `dateofbirth` field.

### 3. Head of Household (HHH) Logic
- If `isThisMemberAHeadOfHouseholdTemp` is set, it updates the `isThisMemberAHeadOfHousehold` field.
- If the person is the Head of Household:
  - The household record is updated with this member's ID and name.
  - All other members in the household are marked as not being the Head of Household.
- If the Head of Household changes:
  - The oldest member is identified and assigned as the new Head of Household.

### 4. Household Statistics Updates
The following fields are recalculated whenever household membership changes:
- `calculatedTempMale`: Number of male members.
- `calculatedTempFemale`: Number of female members.
- `calculatedTempChildren`: Number of children under 18.
- `calculatedTempPregnant`: Number of pregnant women.

### 5. Consistency Checks
- The system verifies if the stored household statistics match the calculated statistics.
- If there is a mismatch, the household record is updated.

### 6. Adding a New Household Member
- When a new person is added to a household:
  - The system recalculates statistics (e.g., gender counts, age groups, pregnancy status) and updates the household record.
