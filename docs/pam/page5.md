# Volunteers Entity Overview

The PAM template includes an entity specifically designed for registering volunteers as system users. Key details are outlined below:

### User Names

Each volunteer must be assigned a unique username. 

Allowed characters include:

 - Letters: a–z
 
 - Numbers: 0–9
 
 - Symbols: dots (.), hyphens (-), at-signs (@), and underscores (_)
 
Best Practice: Assign unique accounts to individual users for improved security and data privacy. Shared accounts (e.g., for an entire branch) should be avoided, as they complicate tracking access and identifying users responsible for data changes.


### Contact Details

An email address is required to create an account for a volunteer. Including a phone number is also recommended. Ensure the correct country code is provided for all phone numbers. The system allows multiple email addresses and phone numbers to be added to a user's profile.

### Active Status

The "**Is Active**" checkbox is selected by default. If unchecked, the volunteer will be unable to log in. This setting can be used to deactivate accounts for individuals no longer affiliated with the organization.

### Reset Password

The "**Reset Password**" checkbox is not selected by default. To reset a user's password, tick this box. A new password will be automatically generated and sent to the user's email.


### Teams 

A dropdown menu allows assignment of volunteers to specific teams. This feature is critical for **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, ensuring volunteers can only access data relevant to their team or responsibilities.
