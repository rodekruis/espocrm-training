**Roles** can provide different types of access to different entities. **Teams** are used to limit permissions to one region/branch. 

Administrator can manage roles in Administration -> Roles. Each role defines access to certain areas. For an overview of role management see [Roles management in EspoCRM](https://docs.espocrm.com/administration/roles-management/).
