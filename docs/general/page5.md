# Role-based access improves security by restricting system access to authorized users. This approach supports accountability. 


**Roles** can provide different types of access to different entities. **Teams** are used to limit permissions to one region/branch. 

Administrator can manage roles in Administration -> Roles. Each role defines access to certain areas. For an overview of role management see [Roles management in EspoCRM](https://docs.espocrm.com/administration/roles-management/).  

For this training it is good to know that rights can be assigned for: 

- Entities 

- Fields 

- Special permissions such as Exports 

- No, Own, Team and All


We distinguish between three types of users, and assign Roles accordingly: 

- National Society users: Project Coordinator, Project Officer and Finance 

- Movement partners: IFRC user, PNS user 

- Technical users: Admin, Api users 


The **Roles** can be adjusted according to the needs of the program.
