User management and authentication are core components of your data management system, ensuring that the right people have secure access to your system and its data. User Management involves tasks like creating, modifying, and disabling user accounts. It also defines the roles and permissions of users, specifying what they can and cannot do within the system. 

**Only Admins can do user management**. You need to contact your EspoCRM Focal point and request adding a new user, assigning a role and permissions, sending access info, password recovery etc.
