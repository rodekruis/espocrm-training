User management and authentication are core components of your data management system, ensuring that the right people have secure access to your system and its data. User Management involves tasks like creating, modifying, and disabling user accounts. It also defines the roles and permissions of users, specifying what they can and cannot do within the system. 

**Only Admins can do user management**. You need to contact your EspoCRM Focal point and request adding a new user, assigning a role and permissions, sending access info, password recovery etc.


See overview of [User management in EspoCRM](https://docs.espocrm.com/administration/users-management/) including types of users, sending access info, password recovery etc. 

Please note: 

- When creating new accounts, you can enable [two-factor authentication](https://docs.espocrm.com/administration/2fa/)
  
- Enforce password limitations such as length, lower case/upper case, special characters. You can do this in Administration -> Authentication
  
- Frequently inactivate or delete users who no longer should have access



EspoCRM also offers functionality to analyze user login activity. Admins can find this in Administration -> Auth Log or Action History or Auth Tokens.
