**This section explains the basic steps to get started with the system: how to log in, change password and language, add users, manage roles and permissions**. 

# How to login
If you are logging in for the first time you will have received your login details in your email. Don't forget to change your password the first time you login. For more details on changing your password see [this page](https://rodekruis.github.io/espocrm-training/general/page2/).

- Enter the password that was shared in the email in the "Password" box
